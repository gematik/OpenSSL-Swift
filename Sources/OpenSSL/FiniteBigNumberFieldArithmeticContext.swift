/// A context for performing mathematical operations on BigNumber over a finite field.
///
/// A common part of elliptic curve mathematics is to perform arithmetic operations over a finite field. These require
/// performing modular arithmetic, and cannot be processed in the same way as regular math on these integers.
///
/// Most operations we perform over finite fields are part of repeated, larger arithmetic operations, so this object
/// also manages the lifetime of a `BN_CTX`. While `BN_CTX` is a silly data type, it does still have the effect of
/// caching existing `BIGNUM`s, so it's not a terrible idea to use it here.
